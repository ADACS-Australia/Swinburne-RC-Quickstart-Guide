If you have not used Nectar/Swin-RC before, then this will create an account for you.

All researchers initially (and without applying for additional resources) get a project trial with 2 VCPUs (virtual CPUs) allocated for 3 months.
This means you can run 2 Small or 1 Medium virtual machine for three months. Or 1 small VM for a total of 6 months.
To get more resources, you need to join a project or apply for one.
