# Dashboard
Once you have logged in, you will be on the *Nectar Research Cloud Dashboard*. This is the first and easiest way to manage your VMs as well as allocation requests.

For now, we will just show you how to use the dashboard to launch a basic instance (Virtual Machine), and then we'll show you how to access the instance via SSH from your local machine.

However, before we continue...

!!! warning "Note"
    In order to access your Virtual Machine you will need to make sure it is set up with:

    1.  a _**security group**_ that allows SSH connections; and
    2.  an _**SSH key pair**_

!!! info
    You can find more information about the dashboard at the [Nectar Research Cloud Dashboard support page](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000076111-nectar-research-cloud-dashboard){target="_blank"}.
