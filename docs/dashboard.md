# Dashboard
Once you have logged in, you will be on the *Nectar Research Cloud Dashboard*. This is the first and easiest way to manage your VMs as well as allocation requests.

For more information about the dashboard see the [Nectar Research Cloud Dashboard support page](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000076111-nectar-research-cloud-dashboard).

We will now show you how to launch a basic instance (Virtual Machine) from the dashboard, and how to access it via SSH from your local machine.

Before we continue, however...

**NOTE:** In order to access your Virtual Machine you will need to make sure it is set up with:

1.  a _**security group**_ that allows SSH connections; and
2.  an _**SSH key pair**_
