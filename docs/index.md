# Swinburne Research Cloud - Quickstart Guide

Welcome to the Swinburne Research Cloud quickstart guide. Here we'll show you how to quickly get up and running with a basic virtual machine.

## Introduction
The Swinburne Research Cloud is what is know as **Infrastructure-as-a-Service** (IaaS), providing Australian astronomers with on-demand, raw IT infrastructure such as CPUs, networking and storage, in a flexible and scalable manner.

Typical uses of the Swinburne Research Cloud include:

- Deploying compute resources for running simulation and data analysis software.
- Hosting of websites, databases, web applications and other online resources.
- Establishing customised access to online data sets and data analysis tools.
- Hosting of online research tools and domain-specific virtual laboratories.

The Swinburne Research Cloud is part of the Nectar Research Cloud, so for more detailed instructions you can also go to the [Nectar Knowledge Base](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions){target="_blank"}
or visit the
[Nectar Research Cloud Tutorials](https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/){target="_blank"}.

## Trial projects
When joining Nectar, all researchers initially (and without applying for additional resources) get a trial project with 2 VCPUs (virtual CPUs) allocated for 3 months.
This means you can run 1 Medium or 2 Small virtual machines for three months. Or 1 small VM for a total of 6 months.
To get more resources, you need to join a project or apply for one.

## Astronomers
Australian astronomers can gain access to the reserved resources of the Swinburne Research Cloud through the [application](astronomy.md#applications) process, after you have [created a Nectar account](getting-started.md#log-in-create-account).
